gnome15 0.10.2 (2015-05-14)
==========================

Gnome15 is a suite of tools for the Logitech G series keyboards and
headsets, including the G15, G19, G13, G930, G35, G510, G11, G110 and
the Z-10 speakers aiming to provide the best integration possible with
the Linux Desktop.

Gnome15 provides:
* A panel indicator (or applet)
* A configuration tool
* A macro system
* A set of plugins

Developers can extend Gnome15 by writing plugins in the Python
programming language, or they can use the provided D-Bus API.
Gnome15 uses GNOME technologies, while staying well integrated with
other desktops such as Ubuntu Unity and XFCE. It should also work with
KDE.

About this release
------------------

Release 0.10.0 is a major release because of the changes to the kernel
driver, which makes it incopatible with the 0.9.x series.

So, users wanting to stick with gnome15-0.9.x should use branch `pre-refactor`
of the kernel drivers found at https://github.com/CMoH/lg4l, while 
gnome15-0.10.x would rely on branch `master`.

Also, this rather unofficial release is made outside russo79.com, since
the website is down for quite a while. The rest of the release is the same
as 0.9.8.

A new "Pommodoro Timer" plugin is now available.
The Gnome shell extension now supports Gnome 3.10

Changes since 0.10.1
--------------------

* g15-config: fix import error with pygobject-3.14.0

Changes since 0.10.0
--------------------

* driver_kernel: fix keymaps for G110 and G15v2

Changes since 0.9.7
-------------------

* Break compatibility with old kernel module implementation.
* The Gnome Shell extension now displays the plugin list in
  alphabetical order. (https://projects.russo79.com/issues/172)
* A new "Pommodoro Timer" plugin is now available.
  (https://projects.russo79.com/issues/240)
* The Gnome Shell extension now supports Gnome 3.10.
  (https://projects.russo79.com/issues/290)

Bugs fixed in this release
--------------------------

* The build now displays an error error if neither PIL or pillow python
  libraries are available. (https://projects.russo79.com/issues/286)
* The stop key (multimedia) now sends the correct keycode when Gnome15
  is running. (https://projects.russo79.com/issues/291)
* The weather plugin now keeps refreshing its data even if it is not
  the active plugin. (https://projects.russo79.com/issues/298)
* The screensaver plugin now correctly displays the user message on
  G19 keyboards. (https://projects.russo79.com/issues/299)
* The g15top module now provides a uptime method. This module is used
  as a fallback replacement for python-gtop on systems that don't
  provide it. (https://projects.russo79.com/issues/301)

Under the hood changes for this release
---------------------------------------

* Exceptions are now logged in a consistent way
  (https://projects.russo79.com/issues/269)
* XDG directories are now used instead of hard coded paths.
  (https://projects.russo79.com/issues/278)
* mono icons are no longer installed by default. These icons are only
  used on Ubuntu systems. (https://projects.russo79.com/issues/285)
* The python interpreter for Gnome15 scripts was changed from 'python'
  to 'python2'. 'python2' is available on all the supported
  distributions except Debian 7 (Wheezy). Users of Debian 7 building
  Gnome15 from source must manually change the shebang lines of the
  files in the src/scripts directory.
  (https://projects.russo79.com/issues/289)
* User custom plugins should now be installed in
  $XDG_DATA_HOME/gnome15/plugins instead of
  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnome15/plugins.
  Support for $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnome15/plugins will be removed in a
  future release.

gnome15 0.9.6 (2013-09-01)
==========================

Gnome15 is a suite of tools for the Logitech G series keyboards and
headsets, including the G15, G19, G13, G930, G35, G510, G11, G110 and
the Z-10 speakers aiming to provide the best integration possible with

* A configuration tool
* A macro system
* A set of plugins

programming language, or they can use the provided D-Bus API.
Gnome15 uses GNOME technologies, while staying well integrated with
other desktops such as Ubuntu Unity and XFCE. It should also work with
KDE.

About this release
------------------

Release 0.9.6 was focused on simplifying and cleaning up the source
code tree as well as the build system.
The new structure has less levels of depth and should be simpler to
maintain on the long term.
Most of the previous sub-projects that were maintained separatedly are
now aggregated into a single tree.
Besides some external dependencies, gnome15 can now be build by
issuing a single './configure; make; make install' command.

The kernel modules have also been updated with the latest upstream
changes.

Of course, some bugs were also fixed.

This is also the first release of Gnome15 to be a 'official' one.
Brett Smith, the original maintainer has decided to retire himself from
the project, and he supports what was until now a unofficial fork of
Gnome15.

He will however keep contributing to the project.
